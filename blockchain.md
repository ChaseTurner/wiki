## Summary

The blockchain is the complete "database" of every transaction that has ever occurred for a cryptocurrency. Every full node (which is the downloaded software) has an identical copy of this database. New transactions are added to this database through "blocks", which are created by miners. When a block is created, it includes a reference of the previous block that was created. The previous block includes a reference of the block before that, and so on. This was how the term "blockchain" was coined.

On TxStreet.com, when a block is mined, the traffic light will turn green and a bus/block will leave for the blockchain.
