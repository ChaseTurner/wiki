# Block Size
The block size limit is the maximum size that a block can be in order to be accepted by the network. The more transactions that are included in a block, the larger it gets. Therefore, the lower the block size limit is for a block, the fewer transactions it can hold. This also means a lower transaction throughput for the network.

On TxStreet.com, the block size limit is visualized by the size of the buses.
